# Features

Living documentation of how each feature/page works. Agents read these to understand existing behavior before planning or implementing changes.

## Rules
- One file per feature: `features/<feature-name>.md`
- Describes HOW the feature works NOW (not history)
- No ticket IDs -- keep clean, consolidated
- Update after every ticket that changes feature behavior
- Use the template: `features/_TEMPLATE.md`

## Example Files
```
features/
├── README.md            (this file)
├── _TEMPLATE.md         (copy for new features)
├── _CONVENTIONS.md      (test and code patterns)
├── authentication.md    (login, signup, session)
├── dashboard.md         (main dashboard page)
├── settings.md          (user settings page)
└── ...
```
